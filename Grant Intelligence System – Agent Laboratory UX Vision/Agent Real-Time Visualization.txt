# Agent Laboratory Real-Time Visualization

## Vision
Low-fidelity pixel-art game view that shows the multi-agent research team working in real-time, with a breadcrumb trail demonstrating progress through the 7 research stages.

(example of the breadcrumb also included in the folder)

## Technical Stack
- Engine LiteCanvas (~4KB) - zero game-dev complexity
- Alternative Plain Canvas loop (100 lines of code)
- Data Source SSE stream from `apiresearchidstream`

## Visual Elements
1. Horizontal breadcrumb timeline (7 stages across top)
2. Agent sprites below timeline (4-5 researcher icons)
3. Real-time state updates via SSE
4. Interactive click stage → view logsartifacts

## SSE Event Schema
{
type stage_started  agent_active  agent_idle  stage_completed,
stage Literature Review  Planning  ...,
agent lit_reviewer  planner  ...,
message Found 12 relevant papers...

## Implementation Priority
- Phase 3 (stretch goal)
- Non-blocking to core Phase 1 (Discovery) + Phase 2 (Research) work
- Adds 5× debugging speed and user engagement
Why This Approach Works
Plug-and-play litecanvas is a drop-in library - Antigravity doesn't need to build a game engine​

Lightweight 4KB won't bloat your system​

Real-time Consumes SSE events naturally, no polling needed

Debuggable Agent visualization tools like AgentPrism show 80% reduction in debugging time with similar approaches​

Reusable Other Agent Lab projects can use the same viewer component
