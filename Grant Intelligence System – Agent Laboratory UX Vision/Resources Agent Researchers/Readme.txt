##CONTEXT

I have noticed that there has been quite some difficulty in developing this part of the application. This is not acceptable because the LMM researcher is the most important component. It is a critical success factor. I see on the readme file on GitHub that you can choose between the fast track, a quick AI-generated proposal that takes 30 seconds, which is great, and the research track, which involves deep autonomous research with real-time team visualisations. However, it states that the research track currently uses a mock implementation and not real AI researchers, as those require additional Python setup. This issue needs to be addressed for the entire application to function properly. To assist with this, I will provide the website, the academic paper, an example, and the code base in the links below Your task is to study all of these j

Overview. Agent Laboratory begins with the independent collection and analysis of relevant research papers, progresses through collaborative planning and data preparation, and results in automated experimentation and comprehensive report generation. As shown in Figure 2, the overall workflow consists of three primary phases: (1) Literature Review, (2) Experimentation, and (3) Report Writing. In this section, we will introduce these phases in detail along with the corresponding involved agents. Furthermore, in Section 4, we will conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses to demonstrate the strengths of Agent Laboratory and its ability to generate research.
