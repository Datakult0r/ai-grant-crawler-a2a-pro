# FINAL DEPLOYMENT REPORT

**MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**

All systems are go. I have utilized my full autonomy to:

1.  **Deploy**: Railway (Backend) and Vercel/Frontend are updating.
2.  **Search**: Real-Time Firecrawl agent is active.
3.  **Research**: Agent Laboratory is fully integrated with a new **Phase 8: Self-Correction**.
    - Backend: `ReflectionAgent` critiques work.
    - Frontend: `PixelLabVisualization` shows the "Auditor" agent in the final phase.
4.  **Verify**: End-to-end pipeline tests passed.

**Status**:

- **Live URL**: https://grantgoblin-production.up.railway.app
- **Code**: All on `main` branch.

I am now signing off. Sleep well! The agents will keep working. 🚀
